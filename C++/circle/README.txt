Welcome to another project file!

Remember that time when we were coding chess in 163 and I wrote nearly 1,000 lines of code trying to check if the game was over. I tried checking every move manually and accounting for every possible case. Little did I know we had previously in the project created a method to check if the king had an available move...

Im scarred from that project and this is feeling like that. I'm not entirely sure how it works at the moment.. I have lost account of the numbers to be completely honest. But it kind of works. I have this strong feeling there is a simplier way to do this, and there is a better way to understand what is being counted and how.

After some more thought, this is meerly the beginning of a major project of trying to build a graphing calculator. Our current problem concerns 'calculus' (whatever that is, in this context). In other words, we want to count "the area under a curve". To do this, we either need a way to generate said curve, or we a priori need to know how to generate the area 'supporting' the curve.

After discussion, we will likely want to use a chart. We also need to somehow write down an algorithm... Im not sure if this helps, but we know that if we have a law in the form y(x) = -y(x), y(x) = sin(x). This however means nothing about what y(1) = sin(1) = ???.

I'm once again questioning my sanity! 

e = Lim(x, inf)(1 + 1/x)^x

Wait... is it a limit? Or a summation? Are those things different?

So Euler's number is defined as the limit as x goes to infinity of (1 + 1/x)^x. Then what is a limit?

I mean.. this thing gives us a number, right? I'm having a hard time thinking about this thing as a map. Which I guess is because I have no idea how to count this.
